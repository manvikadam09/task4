*DESCRIPTION* 

This project showcases the implementation of a machine learning predictive model using scikit-learn to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam). The core objective is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building, training, and evaluating a supervised learning model on a real-world text classification task. The dataset used contains labeled SMS messages and is preprocessed to extract meaningful numerical features using the CountVectorizer method, which converts textual data into a format that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. The data is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately. A Naive Bayes classifier is chosen due to its effectiveness and speed in handling text classification problems. After training, the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix, which visually displays the modelâ€™s ability to correctly classify spam and ham messages. Visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to enhance the interpretability of results through graphs such as bar charts and heatmaps. These plots help understand class distribution and performance metrics clearly.

This project highlights the following machine learning steps:

Data loading and exploration

Data preprocessing and text vectorization

Model training using Naive Bayes

Performance evaluation with metrics and visualization

The final deliverable is a well-structured Jupyter Notebook that combines code, results, visualizations, and commentary, making it an ideal submission for academic, portfolio, or practical purposes.

It serves as a strong foundation for anyone interested in natural language processing, email filtering, or classification models using scikit-learn.
